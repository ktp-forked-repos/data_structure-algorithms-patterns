# Design Principle: Controlled variation

How to design in such a way that changes on classes, modules and systems doesn't affect dependent components?

> Create stables interfaces upon unstable components.

## Variations:

* data
* behavior
* external systems
* os
* ...

## Avoiding variations:

* Encapsulation
* Polymorphism
* Interfaces
* Reflection, introspection, metadata
* Uniform access (access methods)
* Service lookups
* Dependency injection, IoC
* Virtual Machines(jvm, pvm, clr)
