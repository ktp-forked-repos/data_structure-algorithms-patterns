/**
 * Graphs and graphs algorithms
 * 
 * A graph consists of a set of vertices and a set of edges.
 * 
 * Example : Think of a map of a US state. Each
 *              town is connected with other towns via some type of road. A map is a type of graph
 *              where each town is a vertex, and a road that connects two towns is an edge. Edges are
 *              defined as a pair (v1, v2), where v1 and v2 are two vertices in a graph.
 * 
 * A vertex can also have a weight, which is sometimes called a cost.
 * 
 * A graph whose pairs are ordered is called a directed graph, or just a digraph. 
 * 
 * When pairs are ordered in a directed graph, an arrow is drawn from one pair to another pair. 
 * 
 * Directed graphs indicate the flow direction from vertex to vertex.
 * 
 * If a graph is not ordered, it is called an unordered graph, or just a graph.
 * 
 * A path is a sequence of vertices in a graph such that all vertices in the path are connected
 * by edges. The length of a path is the number of edges from the first vertex in the path
 * to the last vertex. A path can also consist of a vertex to itself, which is called a loop.
 * Loops have a length of 0.
 * 
 * A cycle is a path with at least one edge whose first and last vertices are the same.
 * 
 * A simple cycle is one with no repeated edges or vertices for both directed and undirected graphs.
 * 
 * Paths that repeat other vertices besides the first and last vertices are called general cycles.
 * 
 * Two vertices are considered strongly connected if there is a path from the first vertex to
 * the second vertex, and vice versa.
 * 
 * If the graph is a directed graph, and all its vertices are strongly connected, then the directed graph 
 * is considered strongly connected.

        Finding the Shortest Path

        One of the most common operations performed on graphs is finding the shortest path

        Consider the following example: for vacation, you are going
        to travel to 10 major-league cities to watch baseball games over a two-week period. You
        want to minimize the number of miles you have to drive to visit all 10 cities using a
        shortest-path algorithm. 
        
        Another shortest-path problem involves creating a network of
        computers, where the cost could be the time to transmit data between two computers
        or the cost of establishing and maintaining the connection. A shortest-path algorithm
        can determine the most effective way to build the network.

            For example, when we want to find the shortest path from vertex A to vertex D, we first 
            look for any one-edge paths from A to D, then two-edge paths from A to D, and so on.

            This is exactly the way breadth-first search works, so we can easily modify the breadth-first
