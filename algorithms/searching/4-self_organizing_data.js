/**
 * Using Self-Organizing Data
    The fastest successful sequential searches on unordered data occur when the data being
    searched for is located at the beginning of the data set. 
    
    You can ensure that a successfully found data item will be found quickly in the future by moving it 
    to the beginning of a data set after it has been found in a search.

    The concept behind this strategy is that we can minimize search times by locating items
    that are frequently searched for at the beginning of a data set.    

    This is an example of self-organized data: data that is organized not by the programmer 
    before the program is executed, but by the program itself while the program is running.
